# LunarDB Manager:

A management desktop app for the release of LunarDB,
a cache based key-value store(KVS) database which can also be
multimodal using the switch command.

## Note:

For now, it is still being developed so expect for changes in the
README file and the documentations for the Desktop app and LunarDB
itself.

I'm still adding basic functionality of the app but for now I am building a login/sign-in
system for it and might as well make a **website** for LunarDB manager accounts.
